## Importing and tidying data

We want to import the `homicides` dataset and make the necessary changes
as noted in the problem.

``` r
homicides = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
   mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city,state, sep = ","),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), 
    status = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))%>%
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("Black", "White"))
```
