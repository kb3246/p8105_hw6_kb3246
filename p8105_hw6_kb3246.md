# Problem 1

# Problem 2

## Importing and tidying data

We want to import the `homicides` dataset and make the necessary changes
as noted in the problem.

``` r
homicides = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
   mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city,state, sep = ","),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), 
    solved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"))%>%
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")
    ) %>% 
  select(victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city_state, solved)
```

## Baltimore `glm`

For the city of Baltimore, MD, we want to use the `glm` function to fit
a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and
victim age, sex and race as predictors.

``` r
baltimore_glm = 
  homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
      family = binomial(), 
      data = .) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()%>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std_error),
         CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std_error))

baltimore_glm
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 Ã— 8
    ##   term             estimate std_error statistic  p_value    OR CI_lower CI_upper
    ##   <chr>               <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 (Intercept)       0.310     0.171        1.81 7.04e- 2 1.36     0.975    1.91 
    ## 2 victim_age       -0.00673   0.00332     -2.02 4.30e- 2 0.993    0.987    1.00 
    ## 3 victim_sexMale   -0.854     0.138       -6.18 6.26e-10 0.426    0.325    0.558
    ## 4 victim_raceWhite  0.842     0.175        4.82 1.45e- 6 2.32     1.65     3.27

Now we want to obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the
adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to
female victims keeping all other variables fixed.
